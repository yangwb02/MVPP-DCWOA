Due to the universityâ€™s research office policy and the fact that our paper Dynamic Cooperative Whale Optimization Algorithm for Multi-Vehicle IoV Path Planning has not yet been officially published, we are unable to publicly release the data and code at this time. Once the paper is formally published, we will comply with the policy and make all relevant data and source code available. We appreciate your interest and understanding.
